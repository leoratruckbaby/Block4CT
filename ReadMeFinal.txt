Instrution on how to run the program.
I am going to go throw then in steps and explain them as I go alone.
STEP #1: The opining aka main program
This works as a base line where other funtion can stat up when you make a choice.
You get 10 choice with the main program
STEP #2: Add a number
If you chose anything other then 1 then skip to the step were it gives you info!!!
This funcition will add A number of your choice, then the program will send you back to the main program.
STEP #3:Index value 
If you chose anything other then 2 then either skip forwards the step you chose or go back to step 1.
you give the number what you chose then the funtion will show you the index value.
STEP #4: Add a bunch 
If you chose anything olther then 3 then either skip to the step you chose or go back to step 1 or 2.
This will a random number and add them to  your list.
